Leetcode 704 Binary Search (Easy)
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.


Some constraints to notice before writing the code:
All the integers in nums are unique.
Because if we have duplicated elements, then the answer is not guareented to be unique

nums is sorted in ascending order. 
We can use binary search since it is sorted.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (nums[mid] > target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

Lesson learned:

Leetcode 27 Remove Element (Easy)
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

Solution:
